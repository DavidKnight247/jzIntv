Quick Start
-----------

Run 'jzintv --help' to get usage information.  You'll need an EXEC image,
a GROM image, and a GAME image in order to do anything.  You can use
the stock "exec.bin," "grom.bin" and game ROM images that come with the
Intellivision Lives! CD or Intellivision Rocks! CD.


Documentation
-------------

The 'jzintv/doc' directory contains all the documentation I have to
share at the moment.


Game Binaries
-------------

You don't have any?  Go buy an "Intellivision Lives! CD" and/or an
"Intellivision Rocks! CD", you cheapskate!  Go get them here:

    http://www.intellivisionlives.com/   
    
You'll need the game ROMs, EXEC.BIN and GROM.BIN from these CDs.
